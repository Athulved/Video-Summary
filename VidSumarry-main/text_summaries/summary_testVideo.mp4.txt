Here's a summary of the text in plain English:

The game didn't start well for the "Blues" (one of the teams). The other team, "City", scored a goal early on and kept scoring. The Blues were in trouble and couldn't catch up. One of City's players, Buffet, scored three goals, which is called a hat trick. The Blues tried to score, but City's defense was strong and they blocked most of their attempts. In the end, City won the game and the Blues were eliminated from the Champions League. The Blues did manage to score one goal, but it was too little, too late. The better team, City, won the game.
