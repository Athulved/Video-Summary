The writer is criticizing JoJo Siwa's new VIP package deal, which costs $900. For this price, fans get to:

* Watch the show from any seat they want
* Help set up the show (i.e., do unpaid labor)
* Give input on song selection (although the writer doubts this is actually true)
* Get an autograph and wear JoJo's sweaty stage clothes
* Take part in a pre-show Q&A and meet-and-greet
* Get exclusive merchandise and a special laminate and lanyard
* Enter the venue early and shop for merchandise before the show

The writer thinks this is a terrible deal and that JoJo Siwa is scamming her fans by making them pay to do work for her for free. They compare it to a similar deal offered by Gene Simmons, which was also criticized for being exploitative. The writer is amused by JoJo Siwa's attempts to make her concerts more "party-like" and thinks she's trying too hard to be quirky and unique. They also suspect that the "sick prize" she mentions will be something worthless, like a half-eaten sandwich.
